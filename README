NAME
    SquidAnalyzer - Squid access log report generation tool

DESCRIPTION
    SquidAnalyzer parse native access log format of the Squid proxy and
    generate general statistics about hits, bytes, users, networks, top url,
    top second level domain and denied URLs. Common and combined log format
    are also supported. SquidGuard logs can also be parsed and ACL's
    redirection reported into denied URLs report.

    Statistic reports are oriented to user and bandwidth control, this is
    not a pure cache statistics generator. SquidAnalyzer use flat files to
    store data and don't need any SQL, SQL Lite or Berkeley databases.

    This analyzer is incremental so it should be run in a daily cron. Take
    care if you have rotate log enable to run it before rotation is done.

REQUIREMENT
    Nothing is required than a modern perl version 5.8 or higher. Graphics
    are based on the Flotr2 Javascript library so they are drawn at your
    browser side without extra installation required.

INSTALLATION
  Generic install
    If you want the package to be installed into the Perl distribution just
    do the following:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make install

    Follow the instruction given at the end of install. With this default
    install everything configurable will be installed under
    /etc/squidanalyzer. The Perl library SquidAnalyzer.pm will be installed
    under your site_perl directory and the squid-analyzer Perl script will
    be copied under /usr/local/bin.

    The default output directory for html reports will be
    /var/www/squidanalyzer/.

    On FreeBSD, if make install is freezing and you have the following
    messages:

            FreeBSD: Registering installation in the package database
            FreeBSD: Cannot determine short module description
            FreeBSD: Cannot determine module description

    please proceed as follow:

            perl Makefile.PL INSTALLDIRS=site
            make
            make install

    as the issue is related to an install into the default Perl vendor
    installdirs it will then use Perl site installdirs.

    Note: you may not encountered this issue any more, since v6.6
    SquidAnalyzer use site as default installation directory.

  Custom install
    You can create your fully customized SquidAnalyzer installation by using
    the Makefile.PL Perl script. Here is a sample:

            perl Makefile.PL \
                    LOGFILE=/var/log/squid3/access.log \
                    BINDIR=/usr/bin \
                    CONFDIR=/etc \
                    HTMLDIR=/var/www/squidreport \
                    BASEURL=/squidreport \
                    MANDIR=/usr/share/man/man3 \
                    DOCDIR=/usr/share/doc/squidanalyzer

    If you want to build a distro package, there are two other options that
    you may use. The QUIET option is to tell to Makefile.PL to not show the
    default post install README. The DESTDIR is to create and install all
    files in a package build base directory. For example for Fedora RPM,
    thing may look like that:

            # Make Perl and SendmailAnalyzer distrib files
            %{__perl} Makefile.PL \
                INSTALLDIRS=vendor \
                QUIET=1 \
                LOGFILE=/var/log/squid/access.log \
                BINDIR=%{_bindir} \
                CONFDIR=%{_sysconfdir} \
                BASEDIR=%{_localstatedir}/lib/%{uname} \
                HTMLDIR=%{webdir} \
                MANDIR=%{_mandir}/man3 \
                DOCDIR=%{_docdir}/%{uname}-%{version} \
                DESTDIR=%{buildroot} < /dev/null

    See spec file in packaging/RPM for full RPM build script.

  Local install
    You can also have a custom installation. Just copy the SquidAnalyzer.pm
    and the squid-analyzer perl script into a directory, copy and modify the
    configuration file and run the script from here with the -c option.

    Then copy files sorttable.js, squidanalyzer.css and
    logo-squidanalyzer.png into the output directory.

  Post installation
    1. Modify your httpd.conf to allow access to HTML output like follow:

            Alias /squidreport /var/www/squidanalyzer
            <Directory /var/www/squidanalyzer>
                Options -Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
                AllowOverride None
                Order deny,allow
                Deny from all
                Allow from 127.0.0.1
            </Directory>

    2. If necessary, give additional host access to SquidAnalyzer in
    httpd.conf. Restart and ensure that httpd is running.

    3. Browse to http://my.host.dom/squidreport/ to ensure that things are
    working properly.

    4. Setup a cronjob to run squid-analyzer daily or more often:

            # SquidAnalyzer log reporting daily
            0 2 * * * /usr/local/bin/squid-analyzer > /dev/null 2>&1

    or run it manually. For more information, see README file.

    If your squid logfiles are rotated then cron isn't going to give the
    expected result as there exists a time between when the cron is run and
    the logfiles are rotated. It would be better to call squid-analyzer from
    logrotate, create file /etc/logrotate.d/squid with the following
    content:

            /var/log/squid/*.log {
                    daily
                    compress
                    delaycompress
                    rotate 5
                    missingok
                    nocreate
                    sharedscripts
                    postrotate
                            test ! -e /var/run/squid.pid || test ! -x /usr/sbin/squid || /usr/sbin/squid -k rotate
                            /usr/local/bin/squid-analyzer -d -l /var/log/squid/access.log.1
                    endscript
            }

    Be sure that the paths used in this script correspond to your system.

    5. Adjust the configuration

    Make sure that the LogFile path is correct in your squidanalyzer.conf
    file. For instance:

            LogFile /var/log/squid/access.log

    You can also use network name instead of network ip addresses by using
    the network-aliases file. Also if you don't have authentication enable
    and want to replace client ip addresses by some know user or computer
    you can use the user-aliases file to do so.

    See the file squidanalyzer.conf to customized your output statistics and
    match your network and file system configuration.

  Upgrade
    Upgrade to a new release or to last development code is just like
    installation. To install latest development code to use latest
    ehancements process as follow:

            wget https://github.com/darold/squidanalyzer/archive/master.zip
            unzip master.zip
            cd squidanalyzer-master/
            perl Makefile.PL
            make
            sudo make install

    then to apply change to current reports you have to rebuild them using:

            squid-analyser --rebuild

    This command will rebuild all your reports where there is still data
    files I mean not removed by the retention limit. It can takes a very
    long time if you have lot of historic, in this case you may want to use
    option -b or --build_date to limit the rebuild period.

USAGE
    SquidAnalyzer can be run manually or by cron job using the
    squid-analyzer Perl script. Here are authorized usage:

    Usage: squid-analyzer [ -c squidanalyzer.conf ] [logfile(s)]

        -c | --configfile filename : path to the SquidAnalyzer configuration file.
                                     By default: /etc/squidanalyzer/squidanalyzer.conf
        -b | --build_date date     : set the date to be rebuilt, format: yyyy-mm-dd
                                     or yyyy-mm or yyyy. Used with -r or --rebuild.
        -d | --debug               : show debug information.
        -h | --help                : show this message and exit.

        -o | --outputdir name      : set output directory. If it does not start
                                     with / then prefixes Output from configfile
        -p | --preserve number     : used to set the statistic obsolescence in
                                     number of month. Older stats will be removed.
        -P | --pid_dir directory   : set directory where pid file will be stored.
                                     Default /tmp/
        -r | --rebuild             : use this option to rebuild all html and graphs
                                     output from all data files.
        -R | --refresh minutes     : add a html refresh tag into index.html file
                                     with a refresh intervalle in minutes. 
        -s | --start HH:MM         : log lines before this time will not be parsed.
        -S | --stop  HH:MM         : log lines after this time will not be parsed.
        -t | --timezone +/-HH      : set number of hours from GMT of the timezone.
                                     Use this to adjust date/time of SquidAnalyzer
                                     output when it is run on a different timezone
                                     than the squid server.
        -v | version               : show version and exit.
        --no-year-stat             : disable years statistics, reports will start
                                     from month level only.
        --no-week-stat             : disable weekly statistics.
        --with-month-stat          : enable month stats when --no-year-stat is used.
        --startdate YYYYMMDDHHMMSS : lines before this datetime will not be parsed.
        --stopdate  YYYYMMDDHHMMSS : lines after this datetime will not be parsed.
        --skip-history             : used to not take care of the history file. Log
                                     parsing offset will start at 0 but old history
                                     file will be preserved at end. Useful if you
                                     want to parse and old log file.
        --override-history         : when skip-history is used the current history
                                     file will be overridden by the offset of the
                                     last log file parsed.

    Log files to parse can be given as command line arguments or as a comma
    separated list of file for the LogFile configuration directive. By
    default SquidAnalyer will use file: /var/log/squid/access.log

    There is special options like --rebuild that force SquidAnalyzer to
    rebuild all HTML reports, useful after an new feature or a bug fix. If
    you want to limit the rebuild to a single day, a single month or year,
    you can use the --build_date option by specifying the date part to
    rebuild, format: yyyy-mm-dd, yyyy-mm or yyyy.

    The --preserve option should be used if you want to rotate your
    statistics and data. The value is the number of months to keep, older
    reports and data will be removed from the filesystem. Useful to preserve
    space, for example:

            squid-analyzer -p 6 -c /etc/squidanalyzer/squidanalyzer.conf

    will only preserve six month of statistics from the last run of
    squidanalyzer.

    If you have a SquidGuard log you can add it to the list of file to be
    parsed, either in the LogFile configuration directive log list, either
    at command line:

            squid-analyzer /var/log/squid3/access.log /var/log/squid/SquidGuard.log

    SquidAnalyzer will automatically detect the log format and report
    SquidGuard ACL's redirection to the Denied Urls report.

MULTIPROCESS
    If you have huges squid access.log you will be interested by using
    multiprocess with SquidAnalyzer. Using the -j or --jobs command line
    option you can force SquidAnalyzer to use as many cores/cpus as wanted.

            squid-analyzer -j 8 -l /var/log/squid3/huge_access.log

    Here SquidAnalyzer will use 8 cpus to parse the file and compute all
    statistics reports. It will also use much more memory at the same time.

LOGFORMAT
    SquidAnalyzer supports the following predefined log format:

        logformat squid %ts.%03tu %6tr %>a %Ss/%03>Hs %<st %rm %ru %un %Sh/%<A %mt
        logformat common %>a %ui %un [%tl] "%rm %ru HTTP/%rv" %>Hs %<st %Ss:%Sh
        logformat combined %>a %ui %un [%tl] "%rm %ru HTTP/%rv" %>Hs %<st "%{Referer}>h" "%{User-Agent}>h" %Ss:%Sh

    The common and combined log format can have one more field to add
    mime-type report like with the native squid log format:

        logformat common %>a %ui %un [%tl] "%rm %ru HTTP/%rv" %>Hs %<st %Ss:%Sh %mt
        logformat combined %>a %ui %un [%tl] "%rm %ru HTTP/%rv" %>Hs %<st "%{Referer}>h" "%{User-Agent}>h" %Ss:%Sh %mt

    Those are the default format used by squid, you can switch to any of the
    three log format by giving the name at end of the access_log directive:

            access_log /var/log/squid3/access.log squid

    or

            access_log /var/log/squid3/access.log common

CONFIGURATION
    Unless previous version customization of SquidAnalyzer is now done by a
    single configuration file squidanalyzer.conf.

    Here follow the configuration directives used by Squid Analyzer.

    Output output_directory
        Where SquidAnalyzer should dump all HTML, data and images files. You
        should give a path that can be read by a Web browser.

    WebUrl
        The URL of the SquidAnalyzer javascript, HTML and images files.
        Default: /squidreport

    CustomHeader
        This directive allow you to replace the SquidAnalyze logo by your
        custom logo. The default value is defined as follow:

                <a href="$self->{WebUrl}">
                <img src="$self->{WebUrl}images/logo-squidanalyzer.png" title="SquidAnalyzer $VERSION" border="0">
                </a> SquidAnalyzer

        Feel free to define your own header but take care to not break
        current design. For example:

                CustomHeader   <a href="http://my.isp.dom/"><img src="http://my.isp.dom/logo.png" title="My ISP link" border="0" width="100" height="110"></a> My ISP Company
                                                                                                   126,1         Bas

    LogFile squid_access_log_file
        Set the path to the Squid log file. This can be a comma separated
        list of files to process several files at the same time. If the
        files comes from different Squid servers, they will be merged in a
        single reports. You can also add to the list a SquidGuard log file,
        SquidAnalyzer will automatically detect the format.

    UseClientDNSName 0
        If you want to use DNS name instead of client Ip address as username
        enable this directive. When you don't have authentication, the
        username is set to the client ip address, this allow you to use the
        DNS name instead. Note that you must have a working DNS resolution
        and that it can really slow down the generation of reports.

    DNSLookupTimeout 0.0001
        If you have enabled UseClientDNSName and have lot of ip addresses
        that do not resolve you may want to increase the DNS lookup timeout.
        By default SquidAnalyzer will stop to lookup a DNS name after 0.0001
        second (100 ms).

    StoreUserIp 0
        Store and show user different ip addresses used along the time in
        user statistics. Default: no extra storage

    NetworkAlias network-aliases_file
        Set path to the file containing network alias name. Network are show
        as Ip addresses so if you want to display name instead create a file
        with this format:

            LOCATION_NAME IP_NETWORK_ADDRESS

        Separator must be a tabulation this allow the use of space character
        in the network alias name.

        You can use regex to match and group some network addresses. See
        network-aliases file for examples.

    UserAlias user-aliases_file
        Set path to the file containing user alias name. If you don't have
        auth_proxy enable users are seen as ip addresses. So if you want to
        show username or computer name instead, create a file with this
        format:

            FULL_USERNAME IP_ADDRESS

        When 'UseClientDNSName' is enabled you can replace ip address by a
        DNS name.

        If you have auth_proxy enable but want to replace login name by full
        user name for example, create a file with this format:

            FULL_USERNAME LOGIN_NAME

        Separator for both must be a tabulation this allow the use of space
        character in the user alias name.

        You can use regex to match and group some user login or ip
        addresses. See user-aliases file for examples.

    UrlAlias url-aliases_file
        Set path to the file containing url alias name. You may want to
        group URL under a single alias to agregate statistics, in this case
        create a file with this format :

                URL_ALIAS     URL_REGEXP1,URL_REGEXP2,...

        Separator must be a tabulation. See network-aliases file for
        examples.

    AnonymizeLogin 0
        Set this to 1 if you want to anonymize all user login. The username
        will be replaced by an unique id that change at each squid-analyzer
        run. Default disable.

    OrderNetwork bytes|hits|duration
    OrderUser bytes|hits|duration
    OrderUrl bytes|hits|duration
        Used to set how SquidAnalyzer sort Network, User and User detailed
        Urls reports screen. Value can be: bytes, hits or duration. Default
        is bytes. Note that OrderUrl is limited to User detailed Urls
        reports and does not apply to Top Url and Top domain report where
        there is three reports each already ordered.

    OrderMime bytes|hits
        Used to set how SquidAnalyzer sort Mime types report screen Value
        can be: bytes or hits. Default is bytes.

    UrlReport 0|1
        Should SquidAnalyzer display user url details. This will show all
        URL read by user. Take care to have enough space disk for large
        user. Default is 0, no url detail report.

    UserReport 0|1
        Should SquidAnalyzer display user details. This will show statistics
        about user. Default is 1, show user detail report. Disable it to be
        able to remove any user related reports, statistics about URL and
        domains will remain.

    UrlHitsOnly 0|1
        Enable this directive if you don't want the tree Top URL and Domain
        tables. You will just have the table of Url/Domain ordered per hits
        then you can still sort the URL/Domain order by clicking on each
        column. This is useful when you have set a high value to TopNumber.

    QuietMode 0|1
        Run in quiet mode for batch processing or print debug information.
        Default is 0, verbose mode.

    CostPrice price/Mb
        Used to set a cost of the bandwidth per Mb. If you want to generate
        invoice per Mb for bandwidth traffic this can help you. Value 0 mean
        no cost, this is the default value, the "Cost" column is not
        displayed

    Currency currency_abbreviation
        Used to set the currency of the bandwidth cost. Preferably the html
        special character. Default is &euro;

    TopNumber number
        Used to set the number of top url and second level domain to show.
        Default is top 100.

    TopDenied number
        Used to set the number of top denied url to show. Default is top
        100.

    TopStorage number
        Top number of url to preserve on each data file sorted by OrderUrl.
        On huge access log it will improve a lot the performances but you
        will have less precision in the top url. Default to 0, all url will
        be stored.

    TopUrlUser Use this directive to show the top N users that look at an
    URL or a domain. Set it to 0 to disable this feature. Default is top 10.
    Exclude exclusion_file
        Used to set client ip addresses, network addresses, auth login or
        uri to exclude from report.

        You can define one by line exclusion by specifying first the type of
        the exclusion (USER, CLIENT or URI) and a space separated list of
        valid regex.

        You can also use the NETWORK type to define network address with
        netmask using the CIDR notation: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/n

        See example below:

                NETWORK        192.168.1.0/24 10.10.0.0/16
                CLIENT         192\.168\.1\.2 
                CLIENT         10\.169\.1\.\d+ 192\.168\.10\..*
                USER           myloginstr
                USER           guestlogin\d+ guestdemo
                URI            http:\/\/myinternetdomain.dom.*
                URI            .*\.webmail\.com\/.*\/login\.php.*

        you can have multiple line of the same exclusion type.

    Include inclusion_file
        Used to set client ip addresses, network addresses or auth login to
        include into the report. All others will not be included. It works
        as the opposite of the Include parameter.

        You can define one by line inclusion by specifying first the type of
        the inclusion (USER or CLIENT) and a space separated list of valid
        regex.

        You can also use the NETWORK type to define network address with
        netmask using the CIDR notation: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/n

        See example below:

                NETWORK        192.168.1.0/24 10.10.0.0/16
                CLIENT         192\.168\.1\.2 
                CLIENT         10\.169\.1\.\d+ 192\.168\.10\..*
                USER           myloginstr
                USER           guestlogin\d+ guestdemo
                URI            http:\/\/myinternetdomain.dom.*
                URI            .*\.webmail\.com\/.*\/login\.php.*
