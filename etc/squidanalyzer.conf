# By default SquidAnalyzer is saving current collected statistics each time
# a new hour is found in log file. Most of the time this is enough but if
# you have huge log file and don't have enough memory this will slow down the
# parser by forcing Perl to use temporaries files. Use lower value following
# your memory and the size of your log file, on very huge log file with lot of
# requests/seconde a value of 30 minutes (1800) or less should help.
