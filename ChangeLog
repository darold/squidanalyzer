Revision history for SquidAnalyzer

6.4 - Wed Dec 16 22:12:45 CET 2015

This release adds throughput statistics to all reports. It also allow to add
a ufdbGuard log to the list of log files and to report blocked URLs into the
Denied reports. It also adds support to xz compressed files.

There's also a new configuration directive and command line option:

  * Add -t | --timezone and TimeZone directive to change the timezone. When set,
    SquidAnalyzer will read time from log file as UTC time and will add the
    hours specified in the timezone option. This is useful if the log file is
    not parsed on a computer with the same timezone than the squid server.

It also included several bug fixes since last release.

  - Fix graphic overlaps that with one of the graphics. Thanks to Daniel Bareiro
    for the report.
  - Add throughput calculation (ratio between bytes and duration) to all reports.
  - Fix missing largest URL in networks detailed report. Thanks to Juan Martin
    for the report.
  - Fix use of network-aliases together with a network include entry that make
    networks disappears from the report. Thanks to Juan Martin for the report.
  - Add -t | --timezone and TimeZone directive to change the timezone. When set,
    SquidAnalyzer will read time from log file as UTC time and will add the
    hours specified in the timezone option. Thanks to Anderson - BR Suporte for
    the feature request.
  - Add support to ufdbGuard log file. squidGuard and ufdbGuard files can be
    given together with squid log file as a list into LogFile configuration
    file or as arguments of command line. Thanks to Martin Hoffmann for the
    feature request.
  - Fix some division by zero. Thanks to cueda for the report.
  - Fix some potential illegal division by zero.
  - Fix negative duration with http like log file when duration is not set (-).
    Thanks to cedua for the report.
  - Add new throughput (Bytes/sec) column in all reports and a throughput graph.
    Thanks to Mike Lerley for the feature request.
  - Allow parsing of xz compressed files. Thanks to Markus Maikis for the patch.
  - Fix bug with include/exclude networks or clients preventing users reports to
    be built. Thanks to Juan Martin for the report.

6.3 - Mon Oct 12 07:56:29 CEST 2015

This release adds a new report to show statistics about Denied URLs. It also
allow to add a SquidGuard log to the list of log files and to report blocked
URLs into the Denied reports. It ialso adds a pie chart on SquidGuard ACLs use.

There's also four new configuration directives:

  - UserReport to be able to remove any user related reports but statistics
    about URL and domains will remain.
  - ExcludedCodes to be able to exclude some log entries following the TCP
    code returned.
  - UrlHitsOnly to be able to enable the generation of additional HTML tables
    with top Url per byte and per duration in Top Urls and Domains report.
  - MaxFormatError to not exit immediatly when a bad format error is encountered. SquidAnalyzer will
    wait MaxFormatError before exiting.

Note that this last directive is disable by default, so if you still want the
three tables in the reports, you must set UrlHitsOnly to 1.

6.0 - Sat Aug 30 21:48:14 CEST 2014

This major release adds several new features, lot of speed improvement and
some major bug fixes.

  * Multiple access.log files can be processed at the same time.
  * Multiprocess mode can be activated using the -j N command line option.
  * New ExcludedMimes configuration directive to exclude from statistics
    a comma separated list of mime-type or using regex like text/.*.

    a comma separated list of HTTP methods (GET,POST,CONNECT,...).
  * New translation available: pl_PL

Using 4 CPU cores (-j 4) to run SquidAnalyzer can divide by 4 the time used
in single process mode. In single process mode building a 1.4GB access.log
file takes 50 minutes on my computer, using 4 cpus take around 15 minutes.

  squid-analyzer --no-year-stat -j 4 /var/log/squid3/access.log*

This release fixes several bugs and adds two new pie charts about the most use
top second level domains. It is also possible to do DNS lookup of Ip addresses
inside SquidAnalyzer, see UseClientDNSName new configuration directive. This can
slow down dramatically the squid-analyzer performances but you can adjust the

5.2 - Sun Sep  1 21:17:53 CET 2013

This is release fixes lot of minor bugs and adds support to CIDR notation in
network-alias and exclude files as well as some code rewriting and options to
improve speed. New feature to show the top N users that look at an url or a
domain. Adds a new configuration directive, TopUrlUser, to control the number
of users to show in reports.

  - Fix pod2man error with perl 5.18 about non-ascii character. Thanks to
    David Walser for the report.

UPGRADE: You must reinstall all. Backward compatibility is preserved on data
files, but the HTML reports have changed, so after re-installing SquidAnalyzer
you may want to run manually squid-analyzer with the --rebuild command line
option to regenerate those files.  So run the following commands:
        
        tar xzf SquidAnalyzer-5.1.tar.gz
        cd SquidAnalyzer-5.1/
        perl Makefile.PL HTMLDIR=/var/www/squidanalyzer
        make && make install
        /usr/local/bin/squid-analyzer --rebuild
        
should be the normal procedure to upgrade. Change the path to the HTML output
dir if required.

UPGRADE: You must reinstall all but backward compatibility is fully preserved.
Even if backward compatibility is preserved on data files, the HTML and graph
have changed, so after re-installing SquidAnalyzer you may want to run manually
squid-analyzer with the --rebuild command line option to regenerate those files.
So run the following commands:
        
        tar xzf SquidAnalyzer-5.0.tar.gz
        cd SquidAnalyzer-5.0/
        perl Makefile.PL HTMLDIR=/var/www/squidanalyzer
        make && make install
        /usr/local/bin/squid-analyzer --rebuild
        
should be the normal procedure to upgrade. Change the path to the HTML output
dir if required.
