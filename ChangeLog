	  years. Thanks to Jugurtha Massinissa for the report.
	- Prevent buildHtml to create directories on month/day without log.
	- Sort year's view per decreasing years.

	  a new configuration directive (SiblingHit) to disable this feature.
	  Default is enable. Documentation and configuration file has been
	  updated - Thanks to Nathanael BONIN for the feature request.

	  patch.

4.2 - Sun Jan 22 16:52:27 CET 2012

	- Fix network alias issue broken in last release, now data files will
	  store the network alias instead of the default class C network. Thank
	  to Fabrice Prigent for the report.
	- Add support to multiple regex pattern to match networks aliases. See
	  network-aliases file for more information.
	- User aliases are now directly changed into data files instead of html
	  file like before.
	- Add support to multiple regex pattern to match users aliases. See
	  users-aliases file for more inforamtion.
	- Add AnonymizeLogin configuration directives to allow full anomymization
	  of all users/ip.  Thanks to Fabrice Prigent for the request.
	- Add support to squidmime logformat, original request and reply header
	  are simply omitted. Squid and squidmime native format are still the
	  only log format supported.

UPGRADE: If you use network and/or user aliases, even if I try to preserved backward
compatibility, you may want to start with new data files as these informations are
now replaced directly into the data file instead of the HTML files. Changes only
concern file SquidAnalyzer.pm so you can just override it. There's also a new
configuration directive 'AnonymizeLogin' so you may copy/paste his definition in
default squidanalyzer.conf file.

	  from data files. This should be done after upgrading.

UPGRADE: Even if backward compatibility is preserved on data files, the HTML and
graph have changed, so after re-installing SquidAnalyzer you may want to run
squid-analyzer with the --rebuild command line option to regenerate those files.
So run the following commands:

	tar xzf SquidAnalyzer-4.0.tar.gz
	cd SquidAnalyzer-4.0/
	perl Makefile.PL HTMLDIR=/var/www/squidanalyzer
	make && make install
	/usr/local/bin/squid-analyzer --rebuild

should the normal procedure to upgrade. Change the path to the HTML output if
required.
