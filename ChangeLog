UPGRADE: You must reinstall all. Backward compatibility is preserved on data
files, but the HTML reports have changed, so after re-installing SquidAnalyzer
you may want to run manually squid-analyzer with the --rebuild command line
option to regenerate those files.  So run the following commands:
        
        tar xzf SquidAnalyzer-5.1.tar.gz
        cd SquidAnalyzer-5.1/
        perl Makefile.PL HTMLDIR=/var/www/squidanalyzer
        make && make install
        /usr/local/bin/squid-analyzer --rebuild
        
should be the normal procedure to upgrade. Change the path to the HTML output
dir if required.

Thanks to the great work of Nathanael Bonin, SquidAnalyzer has now a new design.

that mean that there is no more needs of Perl modules dependancies to install
SquidAnalyzer.

	  Bytes transfert unit. Possible values are BYTES, KB, MB and GB.

	  DateFormat configuration directive. Thanks to pk-its for the feature
	  request.

	  name. Thanks to Moise Michel for the report.

	  Thanks to Klaus Tachtler for the report
	- Fix install of squidanalyzer.conf, network-aliases, user-aliases  and
	  excluded to be copied with the .orig extention so that nones of these
	  file can be overriden at upgrade. Thanks to Klaus Tachtler for the
	  report.

UPGRADE: You must reinstall all but backward compatibility is fully preserved.
Even if backward compatibility is preserved on data files, the HTML and graph
have changed, so after re-installing SquidAnalyzer you may want to run manually
squid-analyzer with the --rebuild command line option to regenerate those files.
So run the following commands:
        
        tar xzf SquidAnalyzer-5.0.tar.gz
        cd SquidAnalyzer-5.0/
        perl Makefile.PL HTMLDIR=/var/www/squidanalyzer
        make && make install
        /usr/local/bin/squid-analyzer --rebuild
        
should be the normal procedure to upgrade. Change the path to the HTML output
dir if required.

compatibility, you may want to start with new data files as these informations are
now replaced directly into the data file instead of the HTML files. Changes only
concern file SquidAnalyzer.pm so you can just override it. There's also a new
configuration directive 'AnonymizeLogin' so you may copy/paste his definition in
default squidanalyzer.conf file.
