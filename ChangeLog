Revision history for SquidAnalyzer

6.5 - Sun Jan  3 16:12:12 CET 2016

This is a mantenance release to fix an overlaping bug on bytes charts with
last versions of browsers like firefox, iceweasel and chrome.

  - Fix height of bytes graphs that was overlaping on third graph. Thanks
    to Daniel Bareiro for the report.
  - Update russian translation. Thanks to Yuri Voinov for the patch.
  - Update copyright year.

6.4 - Wed Dec 16 22:12:45 CET 2015

This release adds throughput statistics to all reports. It also allow one to add
a ufdbGuard log to the list of log files and to report blocked URLs into the
Denied reports. It also adds support to xz compressed files.

There's also a new configuration directive and command line option:

  * Add -t | --timezone and TimeZone directive to change the timezone. When set,
    SquidAnalyzer will read time from log file as UTC time and will add the
    hours specified in the timezone option. This is useful if the log file is
    not parsed on a computer with the same timezone than the squid server.

It also included several bug fixes since last release.

  - Fix graphic overlaps that with one of the graphics. Thanks to Daniel Bareiro
    for the report.

  - Fix missing largest URL in networks detailed report. Thanks to Juan Martin
    for the report.
  - Fix use of network-aliases together with a network include entry that make
    networks disappears from the report. Thanks to Juan Martin for the report.
  - Add -t | --timezone and TimeZone directive to change the timezone. When set,
    SquidAnalyzer will read time from log file as UTC time and will add the
    hours specified in the timezone option. Thanks to Anderson - BR Suporte for
    the feature request.
  - Add support to ufdbGuard log file. squidGuard and ufdbGuard files can be
    given together with squid log file as a list into LogFile configuration
    file or as arguments of command line. Thanks to Martin Hoffmann for the
    feature request.
  - Fix some division by zero. Thanks to cueda for the report.
  - Fix some potential illegal division by zero.

6.3 - Mon Oct 12 07:56:29 CEST 2015

This release adds a new report to show statistics about Denied URLs. It also
allow one to add a SquidGuard log to the list of log files and to report blocked
URLs into the Denied reports. It ialso adds a pie chart on SquidGuard ACLs use.

There's also four new configuration directives:

    about URL and domains will remain.
  - ExcludedCodes to be able to exclude some log entries following the TCP
    code returned.
  - UrlHitsOnly to be able to enable the generation of additional HTML tables
    with top Url per byte and per duration in Top Urls and Domains report.
  - MaxFormatError to not exit immediatly when a bad format error is encountered. SquidAnalyzer will

Note that this last directive is disable by default, so if you still want the
three tables in the reports, you must set UrlHitsOnly to 1.

A Catalan translation file has been added to the lang directory.

6.0 - Sat Aug 30 21:48:14 CEST 2014

This major release adds several new features, lot of speed improvement and
some major bug fixes.

  * Multiple access.log files can be processed at the same time.
  * Multiprocess mode can be activated using the -j N command line option.
  * New ExcludedMimes configuration directive to exclude from statistics

Using 4 CPU cores (-j 4) to run SquidAnalyzer can divide by 4 the time used
in single process mode. In single process mode building a 1.4GB access.log
file takes 50 minutes on my computer, using 4 cpus take around 15 minutes.

  squid-analyzer --no-year-stat -j 4 /var/log/squid3/access.log*

This release fixes several bugs and adds two new pie charts about the most use
top second level domains. It is also possible to do DNS lookup of Ip addresses
inside SquidAnalyzer, see UseClientDNSName new configuration directive. This can
slow down dramatically the squid-analyzer performances but you can adjust the

5.2 - Sun Sep  1 21:17:53 CET 2013

This is release fixes lot of minor bugs and adds support to CIDR notation in
network-alias and exclude files as well as some code rewriting and options to

domain. Adds a new configuration directive, TopUrlUser, to control the number
of users to show in reports.

UPGRADE: You must reinstall all. Backward compatibility is preserved on data
files, but the HTML reports have changed, so after re-installing SquidAnalyzer
you may want to run manually squid-analyzer with the --rebuild command line
option to regenerate those files.  So run the following commands:
        
        tar xzf SquidAnalyzer-5.1.tar.gz
        cd SquidAnalyzer-5.1/
        perl Makefile.PL HTMLDIR=/var/www/squidanalyzer
        make && make install
        /usr/local/bin/squid-analyzer --rebuild
        
should be the normal procedure to upgrade. Change the path to the HTML output
dir if required.

UPGRADE: You must reinstall all but backward compatibility is fully preserved.
Even if backward compatibility is preserved on data files, the HTML and graph
have changed, so after re-installing SquidAnalyzer you may want to run manually
squid-analyzer with the --rebuild command line option to regenerate those files.
So run the following commands:
        
        tar xzf SquidAnalyzer-5.0.tar.gz
        cd SquidAnalyzer-5.0/
        perl Makefile.PL HTMLDIR=/var/www/squidanalyzer
        make && make install
        /usr/local/bin/squid-analyzer --rebuild
        
should be the normal procedure to upgrade. Change the path to the HTML output
dir if required.
