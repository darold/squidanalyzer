Revision history for SquidAnalyzer

6.0 - Sat Aug 30 21:48:14 CEST 2014

This major release adds several new features, lot of speed improvement and
some major bug fixes.

  * Multiple access.log files can be processed at the same time.
  * Multiprocess mode can be activated using the -j N command line option.
  * New ExcludedMimes configuration directive to exclude from statistics
    a comma separated list of mime-type or using regex like text/.*.
  * New ExcludedMethods configuration directive to exclude from statistics
    a comma separated list of HTTP methods (GET,POST,CONNECT,...).
  * New translation available: pl_PL

Using 4 CPU cores (-j 4) to run SquidAnalyzer can divide by 4 the time used
in single process mode. In single process mode building a 1.4GB access.log
file takes 50 minutes on my computer, using 4 cpus take around 15 minutes.

	squid-analyzer --no-year-stat -j 4 /var/log/squid3/access.log*

Here the full list of changes:

	- Freshmeat/Freecode site is down, release announcement will be done on
	  twitter now, see https://twitter.com/SquidAnalyzer
	- Allow multiple log files to be given at command line arguments.
	- Add support to ETCDIR instead of CONFDIR during installation process,
	  Where real config files are installed on some distributions (BSD).
	- Add support to parse multiple access log file at a time in multi-
	  process mode.
	- Add documentation about multiprocess usage.

	  for more details. Great thanks to Francisco Rodriguez for his help.
	- Add more timing information during SquidAnalyzer execution.
	- Add some other minor speed improvement.
	- Removed call to tell,  we were spending too much time in this method
	  unnecessary.

This release fixes several bugs and adds two new pie charts about the most use
top second level domains. It is also possible to do DNS lookup of Ip addresses
inside SquidAnalyzer, see UseClientDNSName new configuration directive. This can
slow down dramatically the squid-analyzer performances but you can adjust the

configuration directive.

	  Armando Roca Fumero for the report.

	  squid-analyzer usage.

UPDATE: you must override all your installation, Perl scripts, configuration file,

Note that if you run a Perl version < 5.8 you may need the CPAN module Time::HiRes.

5.2 - Sun Sep  1 21:17:53 CET 2013

This is release fixes lot of minor bugs and adds support to CIDR notation in
network-alias and exclude files as well as some code rewriting and options to
improve speed. New feature to show the top N users that look at an url or a
domain. Adds a new configuration directive, TopUrlUser, to control the number
of users to show in reports.

	- Fix pod2man error with perl 5.18 about non-ascii character. Thanks to
	  David Walser for the report.
	- Skip some unwanted code execution when --no-year-stat is enabled.
	- Fix graphs on domain statistics reports.

	  co.uk. Thanks to Thibaut Aubert for the feature request.
	- Add support to CIDR notation in network-alias file. Thanks to Thibaud
	  Aubert for the feature request.

	  the domain report even if the download was bigger than those reported.
	  Thanks to Aubert Thibaud for the report.

	  data over the two days and stored false first and last visit time.

	  date, the format of its value can be yyyy-mm-dd, yyyy-mm or yyyy. This

	- New feature to show the top N users that look at an url or a domain.
	  Add a new configuration directive, TopUrlUser, to control the number
	  of users to show. Thanks to Mr-Ed for the feature resquest.

	- Add WriteDelay configuration directive (default to 3600 - stores one
	  hour of statistics from log file) to be able to save resources on huge
	  log files. On small log file it is not a good idea to set a lower
	  value as SquidAnalyzer will spend his time to write and read from
	  disk. This is a first attempt to speedup statistic reports, especially	  with year and month, but do not expect lot of performances gain.
	- Add regex checker for alias file and improve speed for network and
	  alias replacement. Thanks to jcputter for the report.
	- Fix unwanted message display in quiet mode.

	- Fix bug on ordering column with sorttable. Thanks to David Walser for
	 the report.
	- Fix support to regex with coma in user and network alias file. Regex
	  like "1stFloor 192.168.1.1\d{0,2}" in user-aliases and network-aliases	  was not permitted. Thanks to Steffen Junick for the report.

UPGRADE: You must reinstall all. Backward compatibility is preserved on data
files, but the HTML reports have changed, so after re-installing SquidAnalyzer
you may want to run manually squid-analyzer with the --rebuild command line
option to regenerate those files.  So run the following commands:
        
        tar xzf SquidAnalyzer-5.1.tar.gz
        cd SquidAnalyzer-5.1/
        perl Makefile.PL HTMLDIR=/var/www/squidanalyzer
        make && make install
        /usr/local/bin/squid-analyzer --rebuild
        
should be the normal procedure to upgrade. Change the path to the HTML output
dir if required.

	- Fix install of squidanalyzer.conf, network-aliases, user-aliases  and
	  excluded to be copied with the .orig extention so that nones of these
	  file can be overriden at upgrade. Thanks to Klaus Tachtler for the
	  report.

UPGRADE: You must reinstall all but backward compatibility is fully preserved.
Even if backward compatibility is preserved on data files, the HTML and graph
have changed, so after re-installing SquidAnalyzer you may want to run manually
squid-analyzer with the --rebuild command line option to regenerate those files.
So run the following commands:
        
        tar xzf SquidAnalyzer-5.0.tar.gz
        cd SquidAnalyzer-5.0/
        perl Makefile.PL HTMLDIR=/var/www/squidanalyzer
        make && make install
        /usr/local/bin/squid-analyzer --rebuild
        
should be the normal procedure to upgrade. Change the path to the HTML output
dir if required.

now replaced directly into the data file instead of the HTML files. Changes only
concern file SquidAnalyzer.pm so you can just override it. There's also a new

default squidanalyzer.conf file.
