Description: Squid proxy log analyzer and report generator
 Squid proxy native log analyzer and reports generator with full
 statistics about times, hits, bytes, users, networks, top URLs and
 top domains. Statistic reports are oriented toward user and
 bandwidth control; this is not a pure cache statistics generator.
 .
 SquidAnalyzer uses flat files to store data and doesn't need any SQL,
 SQL Lite or Berkeley databases.
 .
 This log analyzer is incremental and should be run in a daily cron,
 or more often with heavy proxy usage.
