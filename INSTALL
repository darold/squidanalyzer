NAME
    SquidAnalyzer - Squid access log report generation tool

REQUIREMENT
    Nothing is required than a modern perl version 5.8 or higher. Graphics
    are based on the Flotr2 Javascript library so they are drawn at your
    browser side without extra installation required.

INSTALLATION
  Generic install
    If you want the package to be intalled into the Perl distribution just
    do the following:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make install

    Follow the instruction given at the end of install. With this default
    install everything configurable will be installed under
    /etc/squidanalyzer. The Perl library SquidAnalyzer.pm will be installed
    under your site_perl directory and the squid-analyzer Perl script will
    be copied under /usr/local/bin.

    The default output directory for html reports will be
    /var/www/squidanalyzer/.

    On FreeBSD, if make install is freezing and you have the following
    messages:

            FreeBSD: Registering installation in the package database
            FreeBSD: Cannot determine short module description
            FreeBSD: Cannot determine module description

    please proceed as follow:

            perl Makefile.PL INSTALLDIRS=site
            make
            make install

    as the issue is related to an install into the default Perl vendor
    installdirs it will then use Perl site installdirs.

  Custom install
    You can create your fully customized SquidAnalyzer installation by using
    the Makefile.PL Perl script. Here is a sample:

            perl Makefile.PL \
                    LOGFILE=/var/log/squid3/access.log \
                    BINDIR=/usr/bin \
                    CONFDIR=/etc \
                    HTMLDIR=/var/www/squidreport \
                    BASEURL=/squidreport \
                    MANDIR=/usr/share/man/man3 \
                    DOCDIR=/usr/share/doc/squidanalyzer

    If you want to build a distro package, there are two other options that
    you may use. The QUIET option is to tell to Makefile.PL to not show the
    default post install README. The DESTDIR is to create and install all
    files in a package build base directory. For example for Fedora RPM,
    thing may look like that:

            # Make Perl and SendmailAnalyzer distrib files
            %{__perl} Makefile.PL \
                INSTALLDIRS=vendor \
                QUIET=1 \
                LOGFILE=/var/log/squid/access.log \
                BINDIR=%{_bindir} \
                CONFDIR=%{_sysconfdir} \
                BASEDIR=%{_localstatedir}/lib/%{uname} \
                HTMLDIR=%{webdir} \
                MANDIR=%{_mandir}/man3 \
                DOCDIR=%{_docdir}/%{uname}-%{version} \
                DESTDIR=%{buildroot} < /dev/null

    See spec file in packaging/RPM for full RPM build script.

  Local install
    You can also have a custom installation. Just copy the SquidAnalyzer.pm
    and the squid-analyzer perl script into a directory, copy and modify the
    configuration file and run the script from here with the -c option.

    Then copy files sorttable.js, squidanalyzer.css and
    logo-squidanalyzer.png into the output directory.

  Post installation
    1. Modify your httpd.conf to allow access to HTML output like follow:

            Alias /squidreport /var/www/squidanalyzer
            <Directory /var/www/squidanalyzer>
                Options -Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
                AllowOverride None
                Order deny,allow
                Deny from all
                Allow from 127.0.0.1
            </Directory>

    2. If necessary, give additional host access to SquidAnalyzer in
    httpd.conf. Restart and ensure that httpd is running.

    3. Browse to http://my.host.dom/squidreport/ to ensure that things are
    working properly.

    4. Setup a cronjob to run squid-analyzer daily or more often:

         # SquidAnalyzer log reporting daily
         0 2 * * * /usr/local/bin/squid-analyzer > /dev/null 2>&1

    or run it manually. For more information, see README file.

    You can use network name instead of network ip addresses by using the
    network-aliases file. Also if you don't have authentication enable and
    want to replace client ip addresses by some know user or computer you
    can use the user-aliases file to do so.

    See the file squidanalyzer.conf to customized your output statistics and
    match your network and file system configuration.

USAGE
    SquidAnalyzer can be run manually or by cron job using the
    squid-analyzer Perl script. Here are authorized usage:

        Usage: squid-analyzer [ -c squidanalyzer.conf ] [-l logfile]

            -c | --configfile filename : path to the SquidAnalyzer configuration file.
                                         By default: /etc/squidanalyzer.conf
            -b | --build_date date     : set the day to be rebuilt, format: yyyy-mm-dd,
                                         yyyy-mm or yyyy. Used with -r or --rebuild.
            -d | --debug               : show debug information.
            -h | --help                : show this message and exit.
            -l | --logfile filename    : path to the Squid logfile to parse.
                                         By default: /var/log/squid/access.log
            -p | --preserve number     : used to set the statistic obsolescence in
                                         number of month. Older stats will be removed.
            -r | --rebuild             : use this option to rebuild all html and graphs
                                         output from all data files.
            -v | version               : show version and exit.
            --no-year-stat             : disable years statistics, reports will
                                         start from month level only.

    There is special options like --rebuild that force SquidAnalyzer to
    rebuild all HTML reports, useful after an new feature or a bug fix. If
    you want to limit the rebuild to a single day, a single month or year,
    you can use the --build_date option by specifying the date part to
    rebuild, format: yyyy-mm-dd, yyyy-mm or yyyy.

    The --preserve option should be used if you want to rotate your
    statistics and data. The value is the number of months to keep, older
    reports and data will be removed from the filesystem. Useful to preserve
    space, for example:

            squid-analyzer -p 6 -c /etc/squidanalyzer/squidanalyzer.conf

    will only preserve six month of statistics from the last run of
    squidanalyzer.
